#
#Edit these to match your mounts
#you will want to edit /etc/fstab to add the drives.
#sudo blkid to list all drive UUID's.
#Add these to fstab using format:
#
# <file system>                                            <mount point>         <type>      <options>         <dump>  <pass>

#...for each drive (iterating the mount point: disk2, disk3, etc), with the pooled drive defined as:

# Make sure to assign one drive as the parity drive. I like just using /mnt/parity1 (to leave room for additional disks later if you wish).
# This drive must be equal to or greater in size to the biggest data drive in the pool.
